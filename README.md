Very high quality code to visualize minecraft-like worlds in a web browser

 ### projects ~~stolen~~ i mean used (that's what GitHub is for lol):

 a hacked together version of node-minecraft-data (modifications made to reduce webpack build size there is prob a better way)

 prismarine-viewer: dont think i made changes but i do include some random files (/js/lib and /js/prerender.js)

 fragments from stack overflow and wasm guides and examples lol

 :smirk:
 
 yes
