Very high quality code to visualize minecraft-like worlds in a web browser

### projects ~~stolen~~ i mean used:

a hacked together version of node-minecraft-data (modifications made to reduce webpack build size there is prob a better way)

prismarine-viewer: dont think i made changes but i do inblude some random files (/js/lib and /js/prerender.js)

fragments from stack overflow and wasm guides and examples lol
