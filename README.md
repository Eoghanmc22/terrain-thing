# Terrain Generation in a Browser lol
Very high quality code to visualize minecraft-like worlds in a web browser

**_Credits_:**
prismarine-viewer (no changes made, but certain files were included)
node-minecraft-data (modifications made to reduce webpack build size, there is probably a better way lol)
fragments from stack overflow and wasm guides and examples lmfao
@RealStr1ke for GitHub Actions build idea (I guess)
